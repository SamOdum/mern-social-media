# Yet-to-be-named Social Media Site

This is a daring project to build a fully functional social media site mainly using MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJs. I am currently working on this alone but may may eventually involve collaborators.

Apart from the primary stack involved, I am leveraging the functionalities of a number of awesome packages wherever necessary and possible, so I don't needlessly reinvent the wheel.

## Tech stack

Mongo, Express, React, Nodejs
