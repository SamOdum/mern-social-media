# Yet-to-named Social Media Site

This is a daring project I began around May 2019 to build a fully functional social media site using MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJs.

Apart from the primary stack involved, I am leveraging the functionalities of a number of awesome packages wherever necessary, and possible, so I don't needlessly reinvent the wheel.

## Tech stack

Mongo, Express, React, Nodejs
